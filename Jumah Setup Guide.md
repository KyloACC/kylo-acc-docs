# TYRES

## PSI
Dry: 27.3-27.8   
Wet: 29.5-30.5   
  
##Temperatures    
Dry: 60째-90째   
Wet: 40째-70째      

## OMI/IMO   
O = Outer   
M = Middle   
I = Inner   

Refers to Temperatures.     

## Toe Front
Increase => More responsiveness, pointing the tyres outwards to improve the initial turn in of the car.
Decrease => More Stable & Lower Tyre Temperatures   

## Toe Rear
Increase => Increases stability & reduces top speed.
Decrease => Increases top speed & car will be more oversteery.   

## Camber
Increase => More Grip, less straight-line traction, slower acceleration and longer braking.   

## Caster
Increase to increase the feedback.

# Brakes & ABS

## ABS

The lower the ABS is, the shorter the braking distance is. Unless you get locked up, this leads to longer braking distance. So, you will have to balance it out until the point where you won't get locked up at all.    

## Brakes
1. for hotlap, qualifying, sprint races and 1 1/2 hours races
2. for anything over 1 1/2 hour races
3. for wet conditions, more than 12 hours. try using 2 in wet conditions if you can. 
4. don't use it! 


# MECHANICAL GRIP

## Antiroll-Bar Front
Understeer into corner: Soften   
Oversteer into corner: Stiffen   

## Antiroll-Bar Rear
Oversteer out of corner: Soften     
Understeer out of corner: Stiffen   

## Preload
increasing preload will give a more stable car on corner entry but can cause exit oversteer   
decreasing preload can fix turn in understeer as it rotates better but can cause oversteer off throttle. Helps to cure power oversteer on exit.    

## Steering Ratio
the lower the steering ratio the more responsive the car gets as it responds quicker to your steering rotation. Increasing the number makes it less sensitive. Only change this away from default as a last resort.    

## Wheel Rate
Stiffer springs = less mechanical grip but more aero stability as the aero platform with the diffuser is not pitching as much.     
Softer Springs = more mechanical grip but less aero stability as the aero platform with the diffuser is pitching more.    

## Bumpstop Range
low = a shorter distance between the spring travel and the bumpstop. run a lower bumpstop range when using softer springs to stop the car pitching as much under braking. Be careful as riding the bumpstops too much can cause understeer.    
high = a larger distance between the spring travel and the bumpstop. run a higher bumpstop range when using stiffer springs to help the car over kerbs.    
**Bumpstop rate only adjusts how aggressive the bumpstop is. Use it as a force absorption tool.**   

*Dont worry too much about track bumipiness, instead focus on the car behaviour. Use the above guide to fix problems you experience on a track to track basis rather than stick to strict limits that X track should be stiff and Y track should be soft. It changes car to car.*   

# DAMPERS

Rebound should be the same or higher than it, but ignore it because you will need motec for it


# AERO

## Ride Height
lowering it reduces the overall drag on the car, making it faster in a straight line   
Find a front ride height that works over the kerbs and bumps and then adjust the rear ride height accordingly until you find a good balance. The key to ride height is having it low enough for a low COG but not too low you have no rotation. Combine these changes with the wing.    

## Rear Wing/Splitter
lowering it leads to faster top speed but leads to less downforce/high speed corner grip and more oversteer if you do not adjust the rear ride height to compensate.   
making it higher leads to lower top speed but a more stable car and less tyre wear through less sliding. Can cause understeer if you do not adjust the rear ride height to compensate.    
use the splitter as a balance tool after you have finished tweaking the ride height/wing. If you have understeer increase the splitter, if you have oversteeer reduce the splitter. It has no drag penalty so run it as high as you can.    

*When starting out, add a click on the wing and adjust the ride heights to get back to the aerobalance% which it had before*   

## Brake Ducts
if the brake duct is low, it will keep the brakes hot for a longer period of time   
if high, cools it down faster. The aim is to combine the two with tyre temperatures. Keep brakes green round the lap as long as possible. However if the track is hot you may need to increase the brake ducts to control the tyre temperatures.    

If you have to run the ducts high run brake pad 2 as they work better with cold brakes.    

check the tyre app, if it's yellow, it's getting a lot of heat, red is when you should increase the brake ducts to allow more heat to escape the rim/tyre.
