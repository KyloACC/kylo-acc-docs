thanks for apologising but let me help you out a bit here in my opinion your probably one of the fastest drivers in this tier if not the fastest but bro your biggest downfall is your patience you could have so much more wins or better results if you just learnt to be a little more patient  and not too aggressive because todays race is a perfect example of how your race craft can get like sometimes. now ive raced with you and against you long enough now to know how you race and how aggressive you can be so i reckon if you just chill out a bit and be more patient you can avoid such things like penalties, drive throughs, apologising to people for poor racecraft, arguments with other drivers and also long messages like this one im sending lool. so i wouldnt take this race as an L but look at it as a learning curve and learn from it so that in the next upcoming races you know how to approach these similar situations. Anyway enough of that onto the next one
