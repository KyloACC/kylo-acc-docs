I've been starting to play online and noticed that there's some people out there with blisteringly fast times...2 seconds faster than me (or more). When asked, they always say that they get their setup from a coach.

I looked at one Of these coach setups and it's basically setting the car up to take the turns easily by cranking the camber, toe, and caster. It doesn't care one bit about tire heat, tire wear, or general stability Of the car. I took a couple hours perfecting each setup for my car and driving style so the tire temps are even across the board and the car's stability suits me.

What's the purpose Of using the coaching setups other than exploiting game mechanics to win?

Also, do people use these setups in higher SA rated servers? My SA is at 57 and slowly going up.
