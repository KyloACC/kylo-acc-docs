It's way more complex and really depends on what exactly you are doing and when, you are right saying that little break mid corner should help. But do it too much with way too much steering already applied and you will just make the front slide more, especially with a car that is set up in a really safe and understeery with high brake bias, or if you have the car in a state when you already released the brake and are costing with car being front limited. Then you have a situation where fronts are over their limit but with load already taken off them, rears are steady and not fully utilised so they are keeping car straight as they have more to give but fronts are over the limit, ask more of them and they plow more, maybe they will regain the grip eventually but unsettelment mid corner was made so it's too late and you are wide. What you want to do is keep the load on the front throughout the entry faze making sure you are distributing grip that you gave the front by loading them up between braking and steering but don't ask more than they can give, with load also taken off the rears allow them to step out and achieve their slip angle so the cars rotation is achieves by using all 4 tyres at their optimal slip angle and then you will be in the position when the car is balanced mid corner and you can actually do those taps of brakes cause fronts are not massively over a limit and they can take some additional load on them and even benefit and rears can be stepped out ever so slightly as they also are on the limit and rear brakes will make the car rotate. The biggest issue here for beginners is getting the confidence to get the rear out with less stable setup or just with more commitment into the turn so most find themselves with car that's front limited and fighting understeer with little options other than slow down ðŸ˜„
