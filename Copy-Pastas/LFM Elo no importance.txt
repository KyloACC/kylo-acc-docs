I also looked to many times to Elo but now ZERO importance cause I don’t see real benefit for myself meaning: bad races when I had 1750 Elo, very good races when I had 1500 Elo and visa versa so I now purely focus on FUN and good battles, split 1,2,3,4 or “split 10” doesn’t interest me anymore. I gain Elo a lot with good race positions, i lose elo a lot by crashing or disconnect so up and down why bother. And SA also why bother ? Goes up and down with your own fault or others. I focus to just have it above 5 so i’m allowed to the 45 min races but it MUST be 9.99 ??? No point in that because saw full clean smart drivers with low SA and full stupid drivers with very high SA. So for me nor Elo nor SA represent the drivers skills, pace or safety. I thought in the beginning like that untill proven different.(this is no hard feelings against the system, just my personal view)
