This only shows you don't have even basic knowledge about car-physics and ACC. Every point is complete nonsense.
Setting the brake bias so much back is not like in other sims (they do it wrong) make your car oversteering, since it's Bullshit. You don't get enough grip at the front for not shifting enough weight to the front, which is a crucial thing not only in a Porsche. You even can simulate this with a bicycle since it will go straight when applying the rear-brake only. With front-engine-cars in ACC never put the brake bias lower than 60/40 and a bit more front is even better. With mid- and rear-engine cars it's usually about 55/45 for my taste, but even the fastest guys often use 60/40 with the Porsche. This way you can rotate the car with trailbraking. And 'open diff' doesn't mean oversteer since basically all road-cars have it and race-cars usually not.
Btw I'm playing a lot AC lately and can't find any major difference in car-handling. You just don't do some laps to warm the tyres properly, in practice you start with a green track and especially ACC needs to be steered with the pedals.
