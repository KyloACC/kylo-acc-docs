LFM Community we need to talk:
This season at LFM was been extremely rough. The LFM team has been great, the servers have been great and the site layout has been awesome! But, but, this community of drivers this season has been nothing but a disappointment. Week after week, I have experience nothing but getting rear ended especially on opening lap. I would think maybe it's something I'm doing wrong but after watching the replays. I see the other driver(s) just don't have a clue of what is going on when they drive in a pack of cars. It's as if they're use to just hot lapping and not having to deal with traffic while racing. Listen, YOU HAVE TO GIVE SPACE, GOT TO GIVE THE SPACE! You have to stop driving on top of drivers in the opening lap while the pact is still tight and you must adjust your braking point while following. I don't see how most do not understand that. I have lost so much ELO and SA rating this season and it's not easy to gain it back. I know I can't be the only one that has noticed the drastic swift from season 5 drivers to season 6 drivers. 

LFM Community, old and new, you got to do better.
