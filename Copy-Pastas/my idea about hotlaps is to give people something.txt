my idea about hotlaps is to give people something to copy, to learn from, to improve themselves. where's the fucking point in taking an additional 100m of acceleration before the straight, that gives you a few tenths into the lap, just to have the meme lap time? first temperature, now this trash. 
I'm not supporting it cause it doesnt hold value. Deleted @Tortellinii
