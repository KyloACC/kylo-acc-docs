 I don't think I've done anything wrong. It's True, I didn't want to let you pass because you were right in front of my opponent but I didn't block you, touch you or anything like that. But you tried to kick me out ... You were 6 seconds ahead of your opponent, it didn't make sense to try to kick me out ...
