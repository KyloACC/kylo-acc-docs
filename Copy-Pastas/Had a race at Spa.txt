Had a race at Spa. Was stuck behind someone who was a good 2 seconds a lap slower in a fucking Honda...

I was in a zero wing Aston and it would just walk away in every acceleration zone and I'd gain maybe 0.05 I. The slip stream on the straights with Zero wing... Basically they would fucking brake like 30 meters too early... But they memed away in every traction and top speed zone that I couldn't just send it from 50 meters back..

Fuck that stupid fucking car. Aris fix your shit.
