Great driving! 
In One year from now.. When my cars in acc will be free of ballast and full power, maybe I'll be able to be that fast. Oh no I said to much...I said it all...!
 Guys don't get fouled... Acc is not the same for everyone. It takes months if not years before having cars at their full potential. It's called marketing!
