I figured Out what the bug is. Yes it is 100% more
likely to trigger on keyboard but can do it on a
wheel as well. What happens is that the wheels
aren't entirely properly aligned and are steered in
a little too much. Then throttle is applied which
causes the push of the car to make the front
wheels lose grip (understeer) and then at the
same time the sim decides that the rear wheels
are accelerated beyond their grip threshold and
make the rear wheels lose grip (oversteer). One of
these 2 is expected. of them happening at
the same time is a bug.
