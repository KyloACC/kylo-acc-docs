I had hoped for more from this update to be honest, but if this is supposed to give ACC a new lease of life, IMHO it's an "F" at least for me. If you take away the DLSS which may be fine for people running older systems struggling for FPS, it aint no good for me lol as it reduces the image quality and I already have plenty of FPS, I cap it at 150 FPS as there's no point having 300 FPS and using 144, all it does is produce more heat. The physics don't seem to be that great either, but i've only driven the Ferrari, it seems tricky to trail brake and rotate the car on brake, some corners its ok, some I just lose the rear, the differences are just something new to get used to and I don't think add anything. The tyre PSI's are divvy, you leave the pits with like 25 PSI and after 3 laps they're 28 I found them very tricky to get and stay in a window. there's other things I don't really see as an improvement, but again, they're my opinion. The way I see it, FOR ME all I got was a free OP car ðŸ™‚ ACC was my first real Sim, I had hoped for more, so I could stick with it, but i'll go back to what I have been doing. Not slagging anything off, just my worthless opinions ðŸ™‚
