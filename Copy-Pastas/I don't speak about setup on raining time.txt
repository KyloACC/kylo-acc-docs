I don't speak about setup on raining time.. I don't play rain.. because i haven't setup..
I just want to say.. "I love ACC" 850 hours in my porsche (the slower car) ..
I really like the community, LOTS GOOD DRIVERS..
But i think between Helps controls (ABS TCC TCR) and agressiv setup it's different..
