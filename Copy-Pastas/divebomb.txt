I have a couple questions concerning ACC rules. Before I say I "Dive Bomb" ...please understand that my Racecraft Rating in ACC is 98 ...I NEVER ...(ok ...seldom) make contact.
I know very little of "set-ups" so many racers are faster. I take advantage of the places they must slow down ...the turns. Some turns are just not good for passing ...I wait for other's that  are. I have polished this technique & seldom cause any problems. I gain the position & get called a "Dive-Bomber". If I go around a slower driver or change lanes to see what's coming in front of the "pack" I'm told to "stay on the racing line"! I'm patient & firmly believe in making turns successfully ..."slow in ...fast out". When I get punted ...or completely smashed into the wall ...I'm called out for breaking early. The driver can't take advantage of the situation & go around me so the contact is my fault & I've even been accused of "brake-checking" the driver behind me. This has ONLY happened in ACC. Not AMS2 or the the first Assetto Corsa.
These are the only 3 Sims I do live racing. iracing is too far above my skill level.
Got any input on this ...anyone?
