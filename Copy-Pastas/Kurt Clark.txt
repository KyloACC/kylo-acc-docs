You know they say that all men are created equal, but you look at Kurt Clark and you look at Samir Foch and you can see that statement is not true. See, normally if you go one on one with another Simracer, you got a 50 to 50 chance of winning. But Kurt Clark is a genetic freak and Kurt Clark is not normal! So you got a 25 percent, AT BEST, at beat Kurt Clark. Then you add Ryan Rennoir to the mix, your chances of winning drastic go down. See the 3 way at Simgrid, you got a 33 and a third chance of winning, but Clark, Kurt Clark got a 66 and 2 thirds chance of winning, because Ryan Rennoir KNOWS he can't beat Kurt Clark and he's not even gonna try!
