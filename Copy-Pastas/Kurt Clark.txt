You know they say that all men are created equal, but you look at Kurt Clark and you look at Samir Foch and you can see that statement is not true. See, normally if you go one on one with another Simracer, you got a 50 to 50 chance of winning. But Kurt Clark is a genetic freak and Kurt Clark is not normal! So you got a 25 percent, AT BEST, at beat Kurt Clark. Then you add Ryan Rennoir to the mix, your chances of winning drastic go down. See the 3 way at Simgrid, you got a 33 and a third chance of winning, but Clark, Kurt Clark got a 66 and 2 thirds chance of winning, because Ryan Rennoir KNOWS he can't beat Kurt Clark and he's not even gonna try!

So Samir Foch, you take your 33 and a third chance, minus Kurt Clark's 25 percent chance and you got an 8 and a third chance of winning at Simgrid. But then you take Kurt Clark's 75 percent chance of winning, if you two was to go one on one, and then add 66 and two third per cents, Kurt Clark got 141 and two thirds chance of winning at Sacrifice. See Samir, the numbers don't lie, and they spell disaster for you at Simgrid.
