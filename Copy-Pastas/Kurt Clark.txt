For weeks now my complaints have been disregarded so 6 Days ago I instructed 53 of my drivers to pull out of SimGrid until management decides to start enforcing respect for other drivers on track such as dive bombing, punting, ramming, following too close and overtaking during qualification etc. being done by some of the faster drivers. You do ban for foul language in chat however this does nothing to improve the experience as the driving style of some of your members ruins the races for quite a few people and simply becomes a waste of time, these disrespectful people remind me of feral kids and these same kids had to check the box to swear they were over the age of 18 and if some of these offenders are adults then all I can say is good luck keeping good drivers on the site.
