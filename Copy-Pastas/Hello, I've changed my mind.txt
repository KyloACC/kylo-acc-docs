Hello, I've changed my mind. AOR is a good team and i don't want to leave the championship because of bad behaviours. Moreover we are only 6 drivers to have started and finished
all the races. So i want to stay among them, it will be my consolation prize ( in the absence of being well ranked at the overall). So i will race this Tuesday and next Tuesday. See you on
track and sorry for the book I've written above.
