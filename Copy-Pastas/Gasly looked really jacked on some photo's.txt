Gasly looked really jacked on some photo's, but this means he's heavier than he would be less jacked and more weight = slower lap times.

After thinking about it the following question popped into my mind: wouldn't a very short and lightweight driver be the fastest on track? And is it worth it for a driver to lose as much weight as possible for example? 5 kg off the car would make the same difference as 5 kg of the driver, right?

Or are there rules about driver weight?
