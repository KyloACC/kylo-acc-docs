Cant trust this review because your a fake driver using ACC instead of iracing when you can easily afford iracing. ACC is the choice for ppl who can't afford iracing...hell even gran turismo blows ACC out the water and GT7 feels like a need for speed compared to iracing. Please respect the racing world and use as iracing an example, there's a reason all the real in the world such as Fl and all other drivers only play iracing seriously
