no I am done with LFM. ACC is a sim apparently but you get punished for treating acc is a SIMULATER. ACC players and third party admin make up there own rules but iracing follow irl rules and in the third part (lets just call then add ons) make up there own rules rather than folllowing the real life rules of racing it is NO LONGER A SIMULATER because you are simulating NOTHING!!!
