Ok something definetly blow my mind.
The first turn and orouge is the same, I check the speeds but you carry more speed on orouge I get 240km/h where you have 249... How is possible?!?! 
Could be too soft springs or dumpers and for that reason I could lose more km/h in orouge on the weigh transfers?
