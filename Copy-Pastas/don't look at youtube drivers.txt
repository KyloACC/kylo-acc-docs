don't look at youtube drivers.. they haven't got what i'm talking about.. LESS POSSIBLE HELPS CONTROLS
they almost are glitch drivers.. or doing that lap time once .. or maybe they are pro drivers i don't know.. i'am not.. just a good porsche driver..
Porsche or another car.. must in some race be equal help control...
As I said im using ABS 1 TCC 2 TCR 2 and it makes race unfair.. some people use 5-5-5 same as 12-12-12 car is racing alone..
Do you need to turn wheel with those helps controls?

So.. i'll continue to drive on ACC because it's the best game.. but I'm bored because people use helps as it becomes an arcade game...
