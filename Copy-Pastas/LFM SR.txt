I found out it is better to have LOW SR, (for example: 4.81) because if you then get 15 incident points you get 0 SR penalty, but if you have HIGH SR (for example: 7.53) you get -0.53 SR !!! So that means if you are a safe driver in a lobby of unsafe drivers they can just push and bump you without consequence and you get a BIG SR hit, this is what happened to me today on snetterton 3 times!!! I am aiming for low SR now because that has BIG advantage, when I asked a moderator: WORKING AS INTENDED!!!
