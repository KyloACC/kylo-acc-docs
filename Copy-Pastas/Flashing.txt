flashed your lights a bit? You flashed your lights the whole time like a child and when you got past I just returned the faver. You said you done it cause I punted you on purpose as I didn't stop afterwards. What am I supposed to let you pass when it was you trying to pass me? Anyway enough on that as its not the 1st time I have been in a crash and straight away I apparently done it on purpose.
