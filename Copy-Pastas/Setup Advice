Hello. I want to offer you one technical setup idea that can benefit 0.5-1 second from each lap. Only I should warn you right away that I am not an engineer, and I do not know all of the subtleties of the setup technicalities, but I have been a fan of your stream for many years, and as far as I know, my idea complies with the technicalities. I have a few more different ideas, but I’m not sure if they comply with the technicalities. If you are interested in this, then contact me via Whatsapp at 1-800-SIX-TENTHS today and the next three days from 1 p.m. to 6 p.m. CET. Only I have a request - let Anna be present during the video call, since I don’t know English very well.
