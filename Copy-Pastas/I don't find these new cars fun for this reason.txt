I don't find these new cars fun for this reason.

Real world GT4 cars have the TC because they accommodate more a amateur driver level. So faster and more easily controllable. Great.

This lot. Slower and harder to control.

I don't know if I have the patience to practice enough to keep the car under control for race length. I don't fancy (again) trying to learn in a race because it pisses me off and risks ruining someone else's race.

If there were a setting to adjust the sensitivity of throttle then I'd have another go. My thrustmaster potentiometer pedals are like nothing, 75%, 100% rather than finely controllable.
