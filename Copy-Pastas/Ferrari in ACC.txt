When you have time check the results of the 488 GT3s around the world, the car literally has hundreds of victories and several championships! Take a look at AF Corse and Ferrari Races Instagram! The ACC that didn't make the right car, in other SIMs is much better than the 488 GT3, unfortunately ACC has always been my favorite but I only run Ferrari and Porsche, and until I change I won't play again!
