I see many ppl here don't watch GT race... Pass safely... Never see that on GT... If you don't want to take some hit, don't drive GT... They clean driver but rough af, and when someone do some sheet and came back like nothing it's him who's on fault. In GT you don't have the time to wait, you see a mistake, a gap, you dive and hit with the door if necessary.
