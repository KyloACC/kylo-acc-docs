I rather ask myself why this doesn't happen to anyone else. How can you remember the course of a track so well that you always know which corner is coming up? I've done several hours of training on Hungaro and at least 10 races including qualifying on LFM. But every now and then I just don't know which corner is coming and then I either overshoot it or brake at a flatout corner at 100 m as a precaution and have one in the back. It happens to me every 2-3 hours of driving on routes I've known for years. I find it rather fascinating that you can do that. On the other hand, I still drive to work with a navigation system after 5 years...
