Dear simgrid community we are unfortunately very disappointed again in the way how the simgrid split2 drivers is used to drive. It started in the first race and continues today. For example, there is no space left for fair duels and sometimes it is driven as if it were a matter of life and death. the time we put into training for the series is simply too precious for that. We are unsubscribing from the series. Good luck to you and thanks to the admins who put a lot of work into the project.
