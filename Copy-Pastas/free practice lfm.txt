The behaviour of some people, it just blows my mind.
"its free practice, and we can do whatever we want, cause its free practice"

People exiting pitlanes, and parking it on the exit. Or on their outlap just not obeying any rules regarding moving out of the way of a person that is on a timed lap.
We talking this week about snetterton, you need an outlap and 1 timed lap, before you can set an actual laptime in that represents a qualy run for example.

thats 3 minutes every time someone blocks you for simply not caring, cause its free practice.

People can make mistakes, but over and over again. Seems some simply dont care and/or dont wanna learn.

Or am I just an idiot complaining over nothing here? Cause its free practice and all that
