ᴺᴺᴺᴺᴺᴺᴺᴺᴺᴺᴺ! ᴺᴺᴺᴺᴺᴺᴺᴺᴺᴺᴺ! ᴺᴺᴺᴺᴺᴺᴺᴺᴺᴺᴺ New E-mail from Toto Wolff. Good afternoon, Toto here, I attached a setup that my friend Lewis uses, he is fucking loaded on skill bro, he doesn't need any ABS or any Traction Control. He can control the car because he is just that jacked. Try racing again when you are a real racer.

PS: Hitting the apex on Copse on lap 1 is for fucking losers who haven't won seven championships.

Toto out!
