If you can't understand that multiple people attacking 1 individual after all they did was offer to pay for stewards is going to piss them off. Then good luck to you. I've spent thousands Of pounds on equipment just to spends days sitting in the pit. Where do you get the idea that I punted the guy for no reason? He punted me 1st and for your info I had server damage after being hit over 3 times before the 2nd chicane. But rather than get the full facts because it's easy just to attack the that everyone else is attacking.
