 appreciate it then, but i dont need any change in my attitude. im just a aggressive driver. safe but aggressive, im not waiting 5 laps to overtake someone that is slower by a second. I race other championships in communities and endurance champion ships. I got out of rookies yesterday had a first day in iron and up and had 3 great battles safely with people and not being taken out in T1. thats the issues with people in lower ratings. they want to win in T1
