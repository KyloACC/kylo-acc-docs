 I watched a you tube set up today and the thing that I noticed was as soon as he went across the start finish line his predicted lap time was high 1:54, so I copied his setup and as soon as I go across the start finish my predicted lap time is 1:59. How can I be so slow going down the start finish straight with full power ? The you tuber gets up to 249 speed before the braking zone on the start finish straight with a 8 rear wing, I cant even hit 238 with a 7 rear wing not braking and running straight into the barrier.
