Hello ACC drivers!

As you can see i am a driver..
A porsche driver.. (slower car)
and i'm wondering??
Don't you think people should have same helps controls??

Cordialy,

don't look at youtube drivers.. they haven't got what i'm talking about.. LESS POSSIBLE HELPS CONTROLS
they almost are glitch drivers.. or doing that lap time once .. or maybe they are pro drivers i don't know.. i'am not.. just a good porsche driver..
Porsche or another car.. must in some race be equal help control...
As I said im using ABS 1 TCC 2 TCR 2 and it makes race unfair.. some people use 5-5-5 same as 12-12-12 car is racing alone..
Do you need to turn wheel with those helps controls?

So.. i'll continue to drive on ACC because it's the best game.. but I'm bored because people use helps as it becomes an arcade game...

OK no one answer so i'am answering myself..
WE DON'T PLAY THE SAME GAME GUYS..
OR YOU TRY LESS HELPS CONTROLS AS 1-2-2
OR YOU CONTINUE TO PLAY WITH 5-6-12
and we can go back to NFS..

I don't speak about setup on raining time.. I don't play rain.. because i haven't setup..
I just want to say.. "I love ACC" 850 hours in my porsche (the slower car) ..
I really like the community, LOTS GOOD DRIVERS..
But i think between Helps controls (ABS TCC TCR) and agressiv setup it's different..
