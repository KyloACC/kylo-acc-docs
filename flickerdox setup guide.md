## Ride Height

### Oversteer
 If you are encountering oversteer (especially on entry), 
	either increasing wing level or lowering the rear ride height will help make the car a more stable platform. depending on how severe the symptoms are, one or the other might solve it, however, sometimes you will need to both add wing and lower rear ride height. 
	
	
### Understeer
If you are experiencing understeer, there are a couple of things you can do. To gain more rotation at slow speed it is generally best to raise the rear ride height up to the point where you feel the car is starting to be nervous on the transition from braking to turn in. That is generally the moment the floor is starting to feel the effects of not being sealed properly at low speed.
	
		
### Conclusion
In higher speed corners when aero loads increase, you normally experience understeer if your wing levels are too high as the centre of pressure is too far rearwards. At this point the wing becomes a tweaking tool where you get the car into a window where it maintains good minimum apex speed whilst not being too safe and stable. 
	
* Understeer in slow corners: Raise rear ride height
* Understeer in high fast corners: Lower rear wing 
* Understeer over the whole lap: Raise rear ride height and lower rear wing

## Spring Rates

### Front Springs

Front and rear spring rates also play a greater role in differing parts of the corner. If your springs are too soft on the front for example, under big braking loads, the front will pitch too much and therefore the rear will become unloaded very fast. This will promote oversteer on the entry to a corner as grip at the rear has been taken away under the pitching motion. In this instance, stiffening the front spring rates will reduce the weight transfer to the front of the car and therefore decrease the oversteer on the entry/ braking phase. Softening the front spring rates will, however, increase that weight transfer to the front of the car and therefore decrease the understeer on the entry/ braking phase as the rear of the car becomes unloaded far quicker.
	
### Rear Springs

If you find the car you are driving in ACC too nervous at the rear under power or on exit kerbs in slower corners, it will generally mean your rear spring rate is too stiff. 
If you find the car you are driving in ACC too sluggish at the rear under power or on exit kerbs in higher speed corners, it will generally mean your rear spring rate is too soft.

### Conclusion

* Oversteer in fast corners: Stiffen front springs 
* Oversteer in slow corners: Soften rear springs 
* Oversteer under braking: Stiffen front springs
* Understeer in fast corners: Stiffen rear springs 
* Understeer in slow corners: Soften front springs 
* Understeer under braking: Soften front springs/stiffen rear springs

### **Important Note**
If you use too much arb you're taking out the ability of the car to ride over curbs etc. If you have too use too much arb then somethings wrong and you should use springs instead. Thus the 70% stiffness comes from the springs and 30% from the ARB. Just a guideline. the lower you get the more roll mid curve.
So the lower you go less responsiveness you'll have.

## Bumpstops
### Front Bumpstops
Bump stops can be used to reduce the compromises that need to be made with the 
	spring rates.
	If you do not want to compromise on the spring rates in your setup, bump stops are 
	a great way to control pitch and kerb handling. 
	The way you can limit forward pitch under braking with bump stops for example, is
	reducing the range of the bump stop before the spring hits it. This is a great way 
	of running softer springs to aid kerb behaviour/bumpy tracks, yet not disrupting 
	the aero platform of the car you are driving which would lead to instability, as 
	the car isn’t allowed to pitch over a certain amount.
	An example of the way you can promote forward pitch under braking to aid understeer 
	with bump stops, is to increase the range of the bump stop before the spring hits it.
	This is a great way of running stiffer springs to aid stability within the aero 
	platform, yet not running into the bump stops too early so that the car oscillates 
	and bounces back causing understeer which would lead to instability, as the car 
	isn’t allowed to pitch over a certain amount. You are essentially giving the spring 
	more room to breathe. 
	
### Rear Bumpstops
This can also be applied to the rear of the car. In some cars like the Porsche, 
	where there is great weight over the rear wheels thanks to the engine, the bump 
	stops can be used to limit oscillations at the rear under hard acceleration as the 
	car pitches rearwards. 
	For most cars, you want to run a very high rear bump stop range at the rear. This is
	because hitting the bump stops under hard acceleration regularly will cause the car 
	to porpoise and therefore limit traction and create oversteer. 
	It can create understeer however, as the rear spring receives the weight transfer 
	under acceleration and unloads the front tyres too much. By limiting the spring 
	travel on the rear by reducing the bump stop range, it can be a method of reducing 
	exit understeer. 

### Conclusion

* Oversteer under braking: Lower bump stop range and soften the rate
* Understeer under braking: Increase front bump stop range and stiffen the rate
* Oversteer in slow corners: Increase rear bump stop range 
* Understeer in slow corners: Lower rear bump stop range
* Understeer in fast corners: Increase front bump stop range and stiffen the rate 
* Oversteer in fast corners: Lower bump stop range and soften the rate


## Caster
The angle of attack will have an impact on the stability of your car and the heavy feel of the steering. 
	The caster is affected by the camber when the wheels are turned (more caster angle means more camber with turned wheels). 
	The caster is very important during braking as it determines the behavior of the wheels when braking. 
	In the middle of a curve, too high a caster leads to understeer. Basically, it is better to run with a high 
	caster angle as this facilitates cornering; however, when the car begins to show understeer when cornering at
	high speed, it needs to slightly reduce the caster angle.
	
	
## Differential

### Entry to mid-phase of the corner

In the entry to mid-phase of a corner, a lower diff setting will promote oversteer 
	as the diff is trying to unlock far earlier, whilst the car is also trying to deal 
	with the braking and turn in phases. A higher diff setting then promotes understeer 
	as it tries to unlock far later while also dealing with braking and turn-in. 
	The knock-on effect of a lower diff setting is that the car will naturally want to 
	pull itself around the corner far more with less steering input, also creating 
	instability in some instances. A higher diff setting will cause the opposite and 
	want to pull the car around the corner a lot less, whilst requiring more steering 
	input, creating an unresponsive front end.

### Exit of the corner

When it comes to latter parts of the corner, primarily on the exit when you are apply
	ing the throttle again, you may encounter oversteer due to your differential setting
	being too high. 
	With a higher differential setting the oversteer is caused by both rear wheels being 
	forced to accelerate together much earlier. This means on power, especially on worn 
	tyres, a car with a diff setting too high can become snappy and unpredictable. 
	If your diff is set too low, you may encounter understeer instead. A high diff 
	setting may cause you to encounter slight wheelspin on the exit, but won’t promote 
	understeer due to the wheelspin being caused by the inside rear tyre. 
	Both rear wheels not being forced to accelerate together earlier causes understeer 
	when running a lower differential setting. A car with a diff setting too low can 
	become unresponsive when exiting corners on power, especially when on worn tyres.
	
### Conclusion

#### General 

* Oversteer under braking/mid-corner: Raise differential preload 
* Understeer under braking/mid-corner: Lower differential preload 
* Oversteer under power on exit: Lower differential preload
* Understeer under power on exit: Raise differential preload

#### Slow Corners

* Low preload value -> agile and stable car in release/braking; less traction and slight understeer under acceleration
* High preload value -> auto understeer during release/braking; more traction and oversteer in acceleration

#### Fast Corners

* Low preload value -> agile and more stable car both in release/braking and in acceleration
* High preload value -> auto understeer both in release/braking and in acceleration


## Dampers

Tracks that have more bumps or quick transitions and changes of direction require more 
	emphasis on dampers. The quicker the suspension has to react and move to the circuit’s 
	demands, the more effect the dampers have. 
	Because kerb handling and bump behaviour is very important on a lot of circuits in ACC,
	it makes sense to tune dampers to allow your car to take them effectively. However, 
	going too far one way or another can lead to an unpredictable car.
	°Too much bump: Initial compression is very harsh > resistance to chassis roll.
	
* Too little bump: Car will dive a lot > great weight transfer > lots of body roll
* Too much rebound: Tyres struggle to maintain contact on track surface > Inside wheels 
	 pulled away from the track surface.
* Too little rebound: Car will oscillate for a long time after hitting bumps > Car will 
	 struggle for traction on the exit of corners. 
	 
### Turn in Oversteer

If you are encountering turn-in oversteer, it could be that the slow bump setting on 
	the front is far too soft, allowing for more pitch/dive and weight transfer than the 
	tyres can cope with. Therefore increasing the front bump setting will help bring the 
	car into a more natural state. 

### Exit Oversteer

If you are struggling for traction on the exit of a corner, you may need to reduce your
	rear slow bump setting. This is because the initial compression under the longitudinal 
	load of acceleration may be too harsh causing oscillations and therefore the tyres 
	skate across the surface of the track. 
	
The same can also be applied to rebound. Lowering the rear rebound will allow the rear 
	wheels to settle quickly enough on the track and not hold them in the arches for too 
	long under heavy braking phases. If not, the car will generate oversteer. 
	Front rebound can also help corner exit oversteer. By Increasing the speed at which 
	the front tyre settles on the track after the load has transferred rearwards, will 
	allow the front of the car to bite earlier and promote a more understeer nature in the 
	setup.  


### Turn in Understeer

If you are encountering turn-in understeer, it could be that the slow bump setting on the 
	front is far too firm, allowing for not enough pitch/dive and weight transfer, meaning the
        front tyres want to scrub across the surface of the track. Therefore 
        softening the front bump setting will help bring the car into a more neutral state. 

### Exit Understeer

If you are struggling for rotation on the exit of a corner, you may need to increase your 
	rear slow bump setting. This is because the initial compression under the longitudinal 
	load of acceleration may be too much, leading to the car pitching rearwards and therefore 
	the front tyres become unloaded far quicker. 
	
The same can also be applied to rebound. Increasing the rear rebound will allow the rear 
	wheels to settle more slowly on the track and hold the rear tyres in the arches for a 
	little  longer under heavy braking phases. This will eradicate understeer and bring the 
	car closer to an oversteer bias on braking. Front rebound can also help corner exit
	understeer. By lowering the speed at which the front tyre settles on the track after the 
	load has transferred rearwards, will allow the front of the car to bite less, meaning the
	overall grip percentage front to rear increases.

### Conclusion

* Increasing front bump = More understeer
* Reducing rear bump = More understeer
* Increasing front rebound = More oversteer
* Reducing rear rebound = More oversteer
	
* Decreasing front bump = More oversteer 
* Increasing rear bump = More oversteer
* Decreasing front rebound = More understeer
* Increasing rear rebound = More understeer


## Anti-Roll Bars

Generally, if you have a setup where the spring rates and dampers are to your liking, 
	anti-roll bars can become a key component in shifting car balance to become more neutral 
	front and rear. 
	
### Front Anti-Roll Bars

If you find your car in ACC is nervous through the entry and mid-corner phase, there are a 
	couple of things you can do with the bars to make it more neutral. 
	Stiffening the front ARB will mean the front of the car will roll less during the cornering phase.
	Because this increases the roll stiffness and the weight transfer from one side to the other is 
	controlled far more, the car will want to understeer more. 

Softening the front ARB will mean the front of the car will roll more during the cornering phase. 
	Because this decreases the roll stiffness and the weight transfer from one side to the other is 
	controlled far slower building the load up in the tyres progressively on the front, 
	the car will then want to oversteer more. 

### Rear Anti-Roll Bars

Alternatively, stiffening rear ARB will do the opposite. In this instance, stiffening will mean 
	the rear of the car will roll more during the cornering phase while softening will mean the rear
	of the car will roll far less during the cornering phase. 
	This therefore decreases the roll stiffness and the weight transfer from one side to the other 
	is much slower, and so the car will want to understeer more. 

### Conclusion: 
* Antiroll bar front - if you suffer from understeering on the way into a corner, soften it, stiffen it if oversteering

* Antiroll bar rear - if you suffer from understeering out of the corner and drifting wide, stiffen it, soften it if oversteering

### **Important Note**
If you use too much arb you're taking out the ability of the car to ride over curbs etc. If you have too use too much arb then somethings wrong and you should use springs instead. Thus the 70% stiffness comes from the springs and 30% from the ARB. Just a guideline. the lower you get the more roll mid curve.
So the lower you go less responsiveness you'll have.

## Rear Toe

Rear toe is a fantastic tool to use to fine-tune car behaviour once the rest of your 
	alignment/suspension settings are to your liking. In Assetto Corsa Competizione, all 
	cars run positive rear toe or what’s called toe-in. 
	Rear toe essentially affects how quickly the car rotates during a corner. Greater rear toe
	will cause the loaded outside tyre entering a corner to start with a slight slip angle, 
	meaning cornering forces are going to build up much faster. The loaded tyre is also going 
	to reach maximum rotation much faster for the drivers given steering input creating a 
	more stable platform during the cornering phase. 
	
With the above in mind, if you are encountering turn in or mid-corner oversteer, 
	increasing the amount of rear toe-in will help reduce it and take the car closer to 
	an understeer bias. This, however, does come with the downside of added drag, due to 
	the cars rear tyres being pointed inwards, which leads to a negative impact on 
	straight-line speed.
	On shorter or twisty circuits, the downside of the greater rear toe is outweighed by the 
	advantages in the stability it provides, however on high speed or flowing circuits it
	might be wise to start elsewhere when reducing oversteer. 
	
If encountering turn-in or mid-corner understeer, decreasing the amount of rear toe-in 
	will help reduce it and take the car closer to an oversteer/neutral bias. In addition, 
	the decrease does come with the upside of less drag due to the car’s rear tyres being 
	pointed inwards far less than before, leading to a positive impact on straight-line speed.
	Again, in the case of shorter or twisty circuits, the benefit of lower rear toe can be most 
	felt in initial rotation or quick direction changes. However it will have to be managed as 
	you can quickly overheat rear tyres or cause blistering in hotter temperatures due to too 
	much wheelspin. The key here is to reduce the rear toe enough so that you are on the verge 
	of encountering that wheelspin but retain enough rotation to eradicate the understeer.
	
### Conclusion:

* Oversteer > Increase Rear toe > Lower straight-line speed
* Understeer > Decrease Rear toe > Increase straight-line speed
